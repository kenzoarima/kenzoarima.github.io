While handling most of the HTML/CSS stuffs, I was also greatly intrigued by how fast my friend could build the web portal in half an hour (thanks to Codeigniter) In 2011, another friend of mine “jio”-ed me to attend the PHP meetup held at Paypal, and I got to learn a whole lot more about PHP than I did on my own.</p>\n<p>Now 2016, I attended my first PHP Conf Asia, and am totally blown away by the maturity, enthusiasm and wisdom emanating from the speakers and attendees I met.</p>\n<h2>Tutorial Day</h2>\n<p>Tutorial day was a very valuable day. Getting hands on writing Behat tests with Adam Englander, his introduction to Behavior Driven Development (BDD), his sharing of the challenges and experiences he had while deliberating with his colleagues, figuring out what should be the right way to do BDD, impressed me very much. As he related later, when we were chatting after the lessons, BDD is more than just programming, it’s also an art to him — a journey of discovering the right path. So zen, much truth.</p>\n<p>Ben Marks also gave an insightful introduction to Magento 2, explaining how it has matured since Magento 1, embracing OOP (Object Oriented Programming) and PSRs (PHP Standard Regulations). One interesting note he mentioned, which he acknowledged that it could next be improved, is the re-compiling time the framework takes during development — it can be noticeably long currently, whenever a developer writes code and had to wait for the code to be compiled before it is being rendered on the browser. I tend to agree with him too, as I feel the same way while developing with Drupal.</p>\n<p>After tutorial day, there was the PHP meetup in the evening! Davey Shafik from Akamai, Harald Zeithofer from Dynatrace and Dion Hulse from Automattic were in the building to rock the house down. It was an illuminating experience, hearing them talk about HTTP/2, performance tuning and scaling, and how Wordpress changes the world.</p>\n<h2>Conference Days</h2>\n<p>The conference days were equally good, if not better. I like the idea of having a feedback board for attendees to pen their thoughts down, on things that were done well, or if not, how they could be done better. Hosts Michael and Cherie were very receptive to the feedback, especially for Cherie who readily adjusted to give more time for the audience to formulate their thoughts during each post talk’s Q-n-A. Talking about practising Agile development, this is Agile emcee hosting!</p>\n<p>Etsy’s senior engineer, Premshree Pillai’s presentation was interesting, introducing to us how Etsy fosters innovation with principles such as experimentation, optimizing for autonomy, quick iteration and low MTTR (mean time to recovery) to name a few. And to support these principles, they built tools and workflows in-house to facilitate their daily code check-ins, testing and deployment. I am really impressed with the tools being elaborated, and they are on Github! I should really check them out soon. So much to learn from them.</p>\n<p>Another talk which got me amused was by Timothy Chandler. He gave us a lowdown on his journey with HHVM and Hack, the PHP variant built by Facebook, how it can be different from PHP with its stricter syntax, but in exchange for better performance. Then he walked slightly away from the rostrum, and related, down-to-earth manner, how he and his boss, “we’re Australians, we drink”, and how he wrote a CMS with Hack ground up over many beers and while drunk. Of course, he realised he could not really understand what he wrote that night afterwards, and advised not to follow in his footsteps, but heck, I should just try that some day. I mean, this is just so geekily cool.</p>\n<p>The lightning talks were well done too, I feel it was a good avenue for new speakers to share with us their learnings. Most notably Woo Huiren and April Kwong’s talks. Huiren’s youth (he is 19) and enthusiasm to contribute to the open source community is really laudable, and April’s sharing of her learning journey with Laravel was insightful too. She is also in the PHP Women’s group, an initiative to get more ladies on board, as well as to connect with ladies in the PHP arena. I also learned a good amount of neat tips and tricks from the rest of the speakers too.</p>\n<p>Other intriguing talks included playing sounds and beats using PHP, and machine learning with PHP! Through these talks, I see how besides being the regular server side language, PHP can be fun and awesome too!</p>\n<p>The ending keynote by Samantha Quiñones was also an impactful one. It touched the heartstrings at some parts, of how our perception of technology has evolved since the earlier times, when we know the internet has to come from some telephone lines, to the expectation that it should just exist in thin air. “Access to the internet is now a necessity, just like how access to food and water is”, got me really thinking. “The heroes of our revolution will not sit in boardrooms,” goes the quote on her slide deck, as she encouraged us to take all the lessons we learned the past few days and put it into practice at work. Spread the knowledge to others, hone the knowledge and improve ourselves. “It’s easy to learn to code. But to be a programmer also means about lifelong commitment to learn and grow.” So, soo true.</p>\n<h2>And it’s a wrap!</h2>\n<p>All in all, the three days of meeting with passionate folks, experienced and budding developers, the PHP women group, the Javascript folks ;), were a wonderful experience.
